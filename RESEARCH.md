# To tackle

- how to test complex scenarios
- unit vs. integration test
- arrange/act/assert test setup given/when/then
- BDDMockito
- happy/corner case path for sliced test, happy path tests for integration tests
- TestEntityManager will flush first level cache
- Show missing default constructor (check JPA) if using the repository tests in a wrong way
